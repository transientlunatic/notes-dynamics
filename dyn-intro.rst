Classical mechanics is a subject which is hundreds of years old, and
despite its age continues to be an active research area.

Methods and structures in classical mechanics underly more modern
theories. When we think of classical mechanics we think of Newton’s
Laws:

#. Every body persists in its state of being at rest or of moving
   uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to
   change its state by force impressed.

#. The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force
   impress’d; and is made in the direction of the right line in which
   that force is impress’d.

#. To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the
   mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and
   directed to contrary parts.

These are easy to apply to simple systems, i.e. one or two particles
with one or two forces. It’s difficult to apply these laws in
complicated systems, for example many-particle systems, and continuous
systems. The aim of this course is two-fold; first examining
non-familiar examples in Newtonian mechanics, e.g. non-inertial frames;
and develop an alternative formulation of classical mechanics, the
Lagrangian formalism, which is easier to apply to complex systems.In
particular new structures will become clear in this new approach which
do not appear easily in the Newtonian approach.
