Notes on Classical Mechanics
============================

These notes are collected from a number of sources, including my own notes from when I was an undergraduate,
notes I made when I was a post-graduate, and more recently, notes I've written for lectures I have given.

Hopefully they're of some use to someone.

You can find the ``git`` repository for these notes at

   https://github.com/transientlunatic/notes-dynamics

Feel free to leave an issue on that repository if you spot any problems in the notes.
